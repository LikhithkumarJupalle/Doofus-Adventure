# Doofus-Adventure
Doofus Adventure Game is a 3D platformer where players guide Doofus, a cube character, across disappearing green platforms called Pulpits. The challenge lies in timing and precision, as platforms vanish shortly after stepping on them. The goal is to reach the end of each level without falling, while collecting points.
